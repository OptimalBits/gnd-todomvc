gnd-todomvc
===========

TodoMVC Demo Application Implemented using [Ground Web Framework](http://gnd.io)

The demo demonstrates primarily the use of declarative bindings, and a very simple hierarchical routing.

Ground provides out of the box the routing and the persistence in local storage.
Although Ground is written in Typescript, this demonstration is written in vanilla javascript.
